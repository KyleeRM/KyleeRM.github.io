# Kylee Middleton  
## Computer Science ePortfolio

Welcome to my professional ePortfolio for the CS 499 Capstone.

This portfolio showcases my work in:
- Software Design and Engineering
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Databases

Each of these artifacts demonstrates my technical growth throughout the Computer Science program.

Throughout this capstone course, I have demonstrated growth and proficiency in the following course outcomes:

- Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science
- Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts
- Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices
- Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals
- Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources
 
  These outcomes are reflected throughout my code review, artifact enhancements, and reflective naratives. Altogether, they demonstrate not only my technical capabilities, but also my ability to connect software design, security, and algorithmic decision making with organizational strategy and professional communication.

## Professional Self-Assessment

	I began the computer science program at SNHU in September of 2024 with a strong interest in both technology and project management. Throughout the program, I have strengthened my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions while also learning how to communicate technical concepts to diverse audiences. For example, in CS-330: Computational Graphics and Visualization, I recreated a picture that I had taken in a cafe in Vietnam using OpenGL in Visual Studio. This project required spatial reasoning, problem solving, precision, patience, and detailed technical documentation. In CS-210: Programming languages, I wrote detailed code documentation that focuses on clarity and maintainability. These experiences have helped to shape my professional strengths around organization, structure, thoughtful system design, and clear technical communication. 

Collaboration and stakeholder communication have also been major components that have helped me to grow my project management skills. In QSO-355: Resource Estimate and Schedule, I developed a project management plan that required analyzing constraints, estimating resources, and communicating trade-offs in a way that supported organizational decision making. This course helped me to strengthen not only my organizational skills, but also to communicate project considerations in a way that stakeholders with no technical or management background could understand. In CS-340: Client/Server Development, I designed a MongoDB-backed application that required interpreting user requirements into database architecture and interface design. These experiences have strengthened my ability to connect technical implementation with business objectives and reinforced my long-term goal of working in project management for technology projects. 

From a technical standpoint, this program helped me to strengthen my understanding of data structures, algorithmic efficiency, database integrity, and secure software practices. In my capstone enhancements, I have applied data structures and algorithms to improve both the complexity and performance of the application, and I implemented secure database practices such as encryption and transaction management. Earlier coursework, especially CS-305: Software Security, reinforced this security mindset by requiring me to implement certificate generation and evaluate secure communication standards. I think that one of the most valuable lessons I have learned throughout my coursework is learning how to manage trade-offs such as balancing usability, performance, scalability, and security.  

	Developing this ePortfolio has allowed me to look back on my time in the SNHU computer science program and reflect on how all of the skills I have learned fit together. My artifacts for this capstone demonstrate software engineering discipline, algorithmic thinking, database design, and security awareness. More importantly, though, they show my ability to approach a computing problem strategically and communicate solutions effectively. This portfolio shows not only what I have designed and built, but also how I think and tackle projects. I approach my projects as a structured problem solver, a security conscious developer, and with the mindset of a technology leader who is ready to make meaningful contributions to the industry.

## Informal Code Review

As part of my CS 499 Capstone, I completed an informal code review to analyze my existing artifact, identify areas for improvement, and outline my planned enhancements across the required categories.

The video below contains:
- A walkthrough of the original application functionality
- The identification of structural, algorithmic, and design improvement opportunities
- Planned enhancements aligned with course outcomes
