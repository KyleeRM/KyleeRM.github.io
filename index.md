## Informal Code Review

As part of my CS 499 Capstone, I completed an informal code review to analyze my existing artifact, identify areas for improvement, and outline my planned enhancements across the required categories.

The video below contains:
- A walkthrough of the original application functionality
- The identification of structural, algorithmic, and design improvement opportunities
- Planned enhancements aligned with course outcomes
