# Kylee Middleton  
## Computer Science ePortfolio

Welcome to my professional ePortfolio for the CS 499 Capstone.

This portfolio showcases my work in:
- Software Design and Engineering
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Databases

Each of these artifacts demonstrates my technical growth throughout the Computer Science program.

Throughout this capstone course, I have demonstrated growth and proficiency in the following course outcomes:

- Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science
- Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts
- Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices
- Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals
- Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources
 
  These outcomes are reflected throughout my code review, artifact enhancements, and reflective naratives. Altogether, they demonstrate not only my technical capabilities, but also my ability to connect software design, security, and algorithmic decision making with organizational strategy and professional communication.

## Informal Code Review

As part of my CS 499 Capstone, I completed an informal code review to analyze my existing artifact, identify areas for improvement, and outline my planned enhancements across the required categories.

The video below contains:
- A walkthrough of the original application functionality
- The identification of structural, algorithmic, and design improvement opportunities
- Planned enhancements aligned with course outcomes
